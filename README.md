This repository contains a JavaScript function with a potential bug related to null value handling. The function `foo` takes two arguments and returns their sum. However, if either argument is null, it returns null instead of providing a more appropriate response. This unexpected behavior can cause issues in applications that rely on this function. A solution is proposed to handle null values appropriately by using the nullish coalescing operator or other suitable techniques.
